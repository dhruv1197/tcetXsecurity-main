This is a undergraduate final year project of Thakur College of Engineering and Technology, Mumbai, India. 
The project is basically about 'Email Spoofing & IP Address Tracing'.


Currently we are using a Mock Dataset for this project as the availability for datasets for this project has been a challenge. Feel free to reach out or make changes for the improvisation of the code and project.
The project has been submitted so your changes would not give me any form of advantage or cheating for the college project.


Will update with the exact problem statement soon :)

192.168.1.1
8.8.8.8
10.0.0.1
11.0.11.1
12.1.21.1
13.0.13.1
14.1.28.1
15.20.25.30
95.0.95.1
100.0.101.1

These are a few IP Address's that will work and are mentioned in my Mock Dataset.
